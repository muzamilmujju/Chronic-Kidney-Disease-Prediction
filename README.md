# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the likelihood of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in patients using machine learning models trained on clinical data. Early detection of CKD is critical for effective treatment, and this system provides a reliable ML-based prediction tool to support healthcare professionals.
