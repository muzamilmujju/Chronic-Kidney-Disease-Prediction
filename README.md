### Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning  

- **Project Objective**: Develop a machine learning model to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using patient data for early detection and improved healthcare decisions.  

- **Key Contributions**:  
  - Analyzed patient health data (e.g., blood pressure, creatinine levels) for predictive insights.  
  - Utilized machine learning algorithms including:  
    - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: For complex decision boundaries.  
    - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Effective for high-dimensional datasets.  
    - **XGBoost**: Optimized gradient boosting for high performance and accuracy.  
  - Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing:  
    - Handled missing values and outliers.  
    - Performed feature encoding (e.g., one-hot encoding).  
  - Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve model efficiency and interpretability.  

- **Achievements**:  
  - Enhanced prediction accuracy and robustness using XGBoost.  
  - Identified critical health markers like hemoglobin, albumin, and specific gravity as key features for CKD prediction.  
  - Compared multiple models and selected the best-performing one based on accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.  

- **Tools & Technologies**:  
  - **Programming**: Python  
  - **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib  
  - **Platforms**: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook  

- **Future Scope**:  
  - Personalization of CKD risk assessments.  
  - Real-time data integration and scalability for clinical settings.
